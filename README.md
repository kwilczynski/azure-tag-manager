# Tag manager 

Currently the software works for Azure only. 

## Prerequisites

For Azure you need to create service principal.


## Download

You can download a binary for your architecture from https://bitbucket.org/nordcloud/tagmanager/downloads/ 

### Azure
Create service principal file:

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > my.auth
```

and export path to the authorizer:

```bash
export AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION=my.auth
```

## How it works ?

```json
{
  "dryrun": true,
  "rules":  [
    {
        "name": "Tag me stuff", 
        "conditions": [
            {"type": "tagEqual", "tag": "darek", "value" : "example"},
            {"type": "tagExists", "tag": "darek7"},
            {"type": "tagNotExists", "tag": "env"}
        ], 
        "actions": [
            {"type": "addTag", "tag": "mucha", "value": "zoo" },
            {"type": "addTag", "tag": "mucha3", "value": "zoo" }
        ]
      }
    ]
}
```

Equivalent of the same file in YAML would look like:

```YAML
---
dryrun: true
rules:
- name: Tag me this
  conditions:
  - type: tagEqual
    tag: darek
    value: dupa
  - type: tagExists
    tag: darek7
  - type: tagNotExists
    tag: env
  - type: regionEqual
    region: westeurope
  - type: rgEqual
    resourceGroup: darek
  actions:
  - type: addTag
    tag: mucha
    value: zoo
  - type: addTag
    tag: mucha3
    value: zoo
```

Tag rewriter accepts four kinds of conditions (all are case senstive):

* `noTags` - checks if there are no tags set 
* `tagEqual` - checks if a `tag` has a `value` set 
* `tagNotEqual` - checks if a `tag` has a value set different than `value` 
* `tagExists` - checks if a tag with key `tag` exists
* `tagNotExists` - same as above but negative
* `regionEqual` - checks if resource is in key `region` (aka location in azure)
* `regionNotEqual` - same as above but negative
* `rgEqual` - match resource group in a key `resourceGroup`
* `rgNotEqual` - match not resource group
* `resEqual` - resource name equals `resource` 

The supported actions are:

* `addTag` - adds a tag with key `tag` and value `value`
* `delTag` - deletes a tag with key `tag`

When rewriting, the tool will first do a backup of old tags. It will be saved in a file in the current (run) directory. 


## Running 

Tagmanager accepts commands and flags: `tagmanager COMMAND [FLAGS`]. 
```
Usage:
  tagmanager [command]

Available Commands:
  check       Do sanity checks on a resource group (NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET)
  help        Help about any command
  restore     Restore previous tags from a file backup
  retagrg     Retag resources in a rg based on tags on rgs
  rewrite     Rewrite tags based on rules from a file

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for tagmanager
  -v, --verbose   verbose output
```

Commands:

* `rewrite` - mode where tagmanager will retag the resources based on mapping given in a mapping file input (specified with `-m filepath` flag). If `--dry` flag is given, the tagging actions will not be executed

* `restore` - restores tags backed up in a file, supplied by `-f filepath` flag

* `check` - (EXPERIMENTAL) does some basic sanity checks on the resource group given as `--rg` flag 

* `retagrg` - Takes tags form a given resource group (`--rg`) and applies them to all of the resources in the resource group. If any existing tags are already there, the new ones with be appended. Adding `--cleantags` will clean ALL the tags on resources before adding new ones. 



## Changelog

0.4.7

* added retagrg 
* added delTag action

0.4

* better CLI output 
* faster scanning 
* changes in the command line now commands are given directly not as flags

0.3.5

* support for backup of the old tags
* support for restoring tags
* support for rules to be encoded in YAML


0.2

* support for named rules (you must use `name` to add a name for a rule)
* support for a new condition check `rgEqual` and `rgNotEqual` to match resource groups   the syntax is ` { "type": "rgEqual", "resourceGroup": "myRg" }`
* support for checking for no tags `noTags` 
* a less verbose debug level


## Todo 

* Azure ARM policy setting 
* AWS support for EC2
